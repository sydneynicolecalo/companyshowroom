,2242052,"I know I'm going to aggravate most die hard Clancy fans by giving this three stars but hey, it's an 'OK' book.  Could have been about 300 pages less and still got his point across. I did like how Kelly took out an entire gang with ease throughout the book. It just seemed like there was too much going on for all this to be believable though. Come on, the guy is planning a raid on a Vietnam POW camp like the real life 'Bo Gritz' and at the same time is putting away the local bloods and crips with a K Bar.This book would have gotten a better rating for me if less time was spent on the rehab of a drug addict and more time spent on the POW camp raid. (I had no idea before reading this book that it was also about American POW's so that was a nice surprise.) All that buildup for.... Well I don't want to spoil anything but there only about 3 pages out of the 750 that dealt with the snatch of that Russian officer. I think that in the time frame we were dealing with, the local cops wouldn't have cared much if a guy was wasting the local drug dealers. Maybe in today's world they would have to put on a dog and pony show with interviews and the whole nine after pressure from civil rights, but not in the late 60's early 70's.In the end, this book falls short of explaining to the reader exactly why Clark is the special ops/covert guy he is today.",10/18/2005 0:00,Taking Black Ops to the Hood,3

,2242052,"I would not recommend this book.  As nearly all Clancy books it is looooong.  In this book Clancy attempts to develop the history of the character \John Clark\"" aka John Kelly.  But",," to my mind was tortuously unbelievable.  I simply do not believe that Kelly's character would have acknowledged these crimes particularly since he went to such great lengths to protect himself.  Kelly also gets improbably sloppy at the end which to my mind was completely out of character.This will be my last Clancy book.  The promise revealed in \""The Hunt for Red October\"" and developed in subsequent novels seems to have run aground.""",
,2242052,"Clancy's works are exemplars of this school of suspense novel, which is largely driven by endless boring descriptions of infernal devices, catalogs of weaponry and technical specifications of their capabilities rather than character, dialog or even a credible plot. This particular book wastes nearly a thousand words describing how to make a pistol silencer -- which I suppose would be useful if I needed one or had the marine machine shop the hero uses to manufacture it. The plot is ridiculous and the hero is a dipstick who manages to get a woman killed because he is so stupid he drives with her into the ghetto to look for a dope dealer. It's idiotic, but that's what Hollywood wants these days. . .",04/04/2014 0:00,The Popular Mechanics School of Thriller,2

,2242052,"Tom Clancy has created several fictional heroes that are at the heart of his many novels. One, of course, is John Patrick Ryan, who has served his country as a Marine, CIA officer, National Security Adviser, and President of the United States.  With the exception of Red Storm Rising (a book that is not set in Clancy's &quot;Ryan-verse&quot;), Jack Ryan appears or is talked about in every novel from The Hunt for Red October to The Teeth of the Tiger.The other major character Clancy readers have come to admire is John Clark, a man who works for the other side of the Agency as a paramilitary officer.  Whether he is in Colombia using a laser target designator to help bomb a Medellin Cartel member's mansion or leading a multinational antiterrorist team called Rainbow, Clark is the type of man our government needs to use while denying his existence.But John Clark has a past wrapped in mystery, one his family doesn't know much about and is a closely guarded secret.  For John Clark was once ex-SEAL John T. Kelly, Vietnam veteran, avid diver and sailor.But when Kelly's girlfriend is brutally murdered by a Baltimore drug lord's henchmen, the otherwise peacable and war-weary Kelly vows revenge. Dispensing his own version of street justice relentlessly and without remorse, Kelly must not only avoid being killed by the drug dealers, but he also has to evade the dogged detective work of Baltimore cop Emmett Ryan, a World War II vet and father of the future President.Adding to his already complicated life, Admiral James Greer recruits Kelly to participate in a daring rescue mission into North Vietnam.  But when a radicalized American antiwar activist gets wind of this secret military operation, events will drive John Terence Kelly down a path that he never intended to take.Although published 11 years after The Hunt for Red October, this taut and thrilling novel is the first chapter of the long-running Jack Ryan saga.  If you are just entering the Ryan-verse, read this entertaining book first.",09/26/2003 0:00,Revenge without remorse....,5

,2242052,"At some point, Tom Clancy moved from being a great technothriller writer to a strident right-wing journeyman pedestrian page filler.  I think this was the book where that turn became obvious.  While there are excellent technical details and the novel moves at a fairly rapid pace, there are also many strident pages full of racist stereotypes.  Unfortunately Clancy also tries his hand at writing sex scenes and he is embarrassingly bad it.  A disappointment.",04/05/2014 0:00,It's OK,2
,2242052,"Finally, a novel by Clancy that's not techno-porn. And, really, that's why it's both the highest-rated and best of his works. Unlike, say, a good third of Cardinal of the Kremlin (which was also good) or a good half of Sum of All Fears, this is driven by character and plot development, not technology. In addition, this novel doesn't star Jack Ryan and doesn't deal with the Cold War (comparatively). Maybe Clancy should've stuck with this type of writing.Yes, this is a good novel. Clancy includes some of the espionage-type of narrative without actually dealing with spies or international politics, and he even wraps up all the subplots nicely. Since there aren't a thousand things going on at all times, like in most of his other works, he can focus on believability with this one. Without going into details, for instance, the change in Sandy's attitudes about what John does is natural. The foundation of Clark's methods, attitudes, and profession here are both fascinating and believable. This is a very engaging read with an intriguing, well-developed plot that focuses on character development and not every detail in both the construction and detonation of a hydrogen bomb. That is why all the reviews here and elsewhere paint this as the best of Clancy's novels (or among the best) and why it's a great read even without knowing every detail of decades of Jack Ryan's life.

,2242052,"This story is set in Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan series.  By the chronology of that series it is the first book, but should NOT be read first.  In order to appreciate its finer points, readers should be familiar with CIA operative John Clark and his behind-the-scenes role.  This is John Clark's backstory.John Clark was once John Kelly, a Navy SEAL and Vietnam veteran.  He sails, dives and enjoys life.  When his girlfriend is killed by drug dealers, John is devastated.  His anguish turns to rage as he learns about the trafficking in drugs and human lives in his city, unnoticed by John and almost everyone else.  He puts his combat skills back to work as he stalks and kills violent criminals.  He also begins working for the Federal government on very similar missions.  It becomes increasingly likely that his two lives will collide.This is an excellent book which explains much about the skills, attitudes and loyalties John Clark demonstrates throughout the Jack Ryan series.  Several familiar faces appear briefly in the story, making intriguing connections.  Well-read Tom Clancy fans will enjoy these revelations, but they are not necessary to follow the story.

It is definitely a 4-5 star book.The reason that I give it 3 stars is the Kindle conversion. The formatting is just not professional enough for a Kindle book priced at $6-$7. There are a LOT of misspelled words, and many of them aren't even properly-spelled but wrong words -- they are just gibberish. Also, Clancy makes heavy use of italicized text, which the Kindle version tends to munge up. If it was one or two, I could live with it, but it's at least one every few pages, and some have so many that it distracts from the story.Summary: great story, fantastic writing, just a horrible editing job in the Kindle version.",03/12/2010 0:00,"Great book, bad Kindle conversion",3

It has adventure and danger, as do all his books, but it deals with love and heartbreak to a degree not seen in his other books.  This book is very much about honor and duty, sacrifice and betrayal.  There are many segments of this book which are unforgettable!  This book is one of a kind in its genre and is well deserving of the label &quot;Modern  Classic.&quot;  In this book we see the beginnings of a central character in several Clancy books written earlier, but chonologically later in time, the enigmatic Mr Clark.  No problem is too difficult for Mr Clark in the other novels, and now we know why.

,2242052,"This is the story of how John Kelly became Mr. Clark, the CIA operative that plays such a big part of early Clancy books. It begins with Vietnam veteran Kelly in the midst of getting over his wife's death. He has a chance meeting with a pretty young woman and a night of passion quickly turns to love. The girl's past soon comes back to haunt her however as the pimps she escaped from find her. Kelly is sent reeling with another death of someone close to him. He vows revenge on the entire gang of drug dealers and discovers there are many more girls like the one he loved that need help.While Kelly is carrying out his plans, he is also recruited by the military to run an operation that sends him back to Vietnam. American POWs have been found there. Kelly is put in charge of designing a mission, training the men and leading them to rescue the prisoners.Without Remorse wasn't one of my favorite Clancy books. The Vietnam POW story line isn't heavy enough and the final raid is anticlimactic. The story line with the girl and the drug gang takes up the bulk of the book and while it's interesting to a point, it also goes on too long. I got bored during much of that plot.

Clark picks up a prostitute named Pam, and Clark befriends her since she has no family, and she tells Clark about what the pushers do to her and this is how she makes her money, so with anger flowing through his blood, Clark is ambushed by the pushers in the ghetto, and Pam is taken from the jeep and is tortured and beaten. Now with Pam dead, John decides to get back at them by bringing them war, since they asked for it, and they got it.Now with John fighting the pushers, John befriends Sandy, a doctor at the local hospital for Pam, and they become close, and she does not know what John is doing since he keeps it quiet. Now John is sent to North Vietnam to rescue a down F-14 Tomcat fighter pilot being held prisoner by the North Vietnamese and the Soviets.

,2242052,"I haven't read much Clancy since I was a teen reading Red Storm Rising which I liked a lot.  This book however was a disappointment.  First of all there's too many different stories happening at once.  It's got spy tales and intrigue (a left wing activist and his KGB contacts), police procedural with Det. Ryan (Jack Ryan's dad), Mafia connections and drug dealing, the usual high tech military aspects with all the jargon, and a long drawn out POW rescue attempt in Vietnam. By far the worst and main story is of Navy Seal/CIA recruit superhero John Kelly/Clark and his bloodthirsty goal of revenge.John's wife was killed in a tragic car accident 6 months earlier and so he picks up a skinny and beat down looking hitchhiker off the street and takes her to his boat.  Almost immediate she pushes him down onto the deck and makes love to him. There is supposedly a connection because each sees each others pain and suffering and understands each other.  She doesn't mind that the blood type of at least three different men must still be inside her from the previous night of being treated like a dog by her pimps and drug pushers before she escaped.  Well soon she is killed and Kelly goes on his revenge rampage by just sneaking up to drug pushers dressed as a drunken hobo and shooting them point blank.  Sometimes he doesn't even ask any questions of them yet he always knows where to go to next.  After one double homicide, Kelly is escaping the scene when he sees a nurse being threatened with a knife by a kid who wants money.  He quickly dislocates the kids shoulder takes his knife and drives it through his skull.  Eventually, he gets all the bad guys and suffers no consequences.  In fact he gets a job at the CIA.In Clancy's Vietnam, all the aviators and POWs are of course heroes and the Vietnamese are routinely referred to through most of the book as little monkeys, and little yellow cowards, brutal child rapists and so on.  I would have like to have heard some more honesty here.  He could mention something about the US propping up a Latin American style terror regime in S. Vietnam.  The bombing of S. Vietnam, the use of chemical warfare  on the land to drive the people into concentration camps and the eventual spread of this war all over to N. Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos.  The US dropped more bombs on Cambodia for instance than the entire Allied forces during the entire second world war.  The only character who seems to know this is going on is portrayed as a leftist pot smoking traitor who is forced to commit suicide by Kelly.  This book kinda makes me sick the more I think about it and I shall not go on.  I know Clancy supports right wing ideology and sometimes is on right wing radio and TV and with this book makes porn for the right.  With that said as long as you know this is fantasy and fiction it's ok, because there are good parts to the book.  I mostly focused on the bad because I don't want people to think this is realistic or that the world works like this or that everything is in black and white. For a more realistic perspective of the drug trade on the street level watch the series The Wire and grow some sympathy for people who are trying to survive in a different way of life from you before you cheer some fantasy right wing superhero murdering them.",09/16/2011 0:00,Right wing fantasy.

Without Remorse definitly held up.The things I disliked about the book were things that would make it not a good book.  I generally dislike the language a lot of the characters used, especially those in the drug rings.  But I realize that is probably true to life and must tolerate it in that snese.  It does serve the purpose of making me dislike the drug cartels even more than I already did, if that's possible.I felt fear and apprehension while Kelly/Clark returns to VietNam.  I understood why he did the things he felt he had to do, though terribly wrong in principle.  I liked most that Kelly/Clark realized he could not change the world, only contribute in some small sense.  If he believed he could right all the wrongs in the world, it wouldn't be as compelling to read.  But he wants to typify the idea that good people cannot stand aside and let evil occur, else they are supporting that evil.  But he does it with a vigilante type justice that should only be taken up in novels.I relly liked how the Ryan family became involved in the story.  If foreshadowed and made me think what would Emmett think knowing his son will soon be under the protection of that 'Invisible Man'?Without Remorse is a definite must to those who are Clancy fans.

,2242052,"The first thing you notice about 'Without Remorse' is that it is NOT a Jack Ryan adventure, in fact he is nowhere to be found within the many pages of this book.  Clancy took a gamble on this knowing it would ultimately turn off some of his die hard Ryan fans, but if you pass this one up, you are losing out on quite a literary adventure.  Only John Clark comes close to being as well developed as Ryan...but we have no idea about how he came to be who he is today, and more important, the WHY?  'Without Remorse' tells John's tale, which is far from a pretty one.John's tale begins during the Vietnam War and moves from one continent to another and show's us what John is made of, and why. He never set out to be John Clark (not his real name), in fact the events which transpire and ultimately force John to do the unthinkable are horrific indeed, but it makes you wonder what you would do given the same circumstances...  I wouldn't go so far as to say I would actually do the same, but would I entertain the thought?  Yeah, sure.  What limits do we have as humans?  We get to find out Clarks here in a decidedly different story than what we have come to expect from Clancy, and easily one of the better novels he has produced.  I also very much enjoyed 'Rainbow Six' which seemed to be panned by many, but hey, I'm a BIG John Clark fan...

I read some of his stuff, but I find that his books too often drown you in pages of technical details that have little or nothing to do with the actual plot.

Without Remorse is free from most of these dry details though and that makes it a great book.  I think this is because there is simply so much going on that Clancy doesn't have time to fit those details anywhere.This book is pretty unique for Clancy in that it explores the history of his recurring CIA character, John Clark (aka John Kelly).  The action and suspense in this book are, in my opinion, second to none when matched against anything else Clancy has written (or at least that I've read).  Clancy paints a great picture of a man with problems who falls for a woman with much bigger problems, all while trying to do his job for the CIA.  A must read, not for only Clancy fans, but for anyone who enjoys edge of your seat suspense.",06/08/2004 0:00,Clancy's Best,5

The girl is killed and the Navy seal plans to take his own style of justice to the drug dealers and eventually the ones who killed the girl. Along the way he is challenged by the Navy to go on a deadly mission inside of Viet Nam. Fortunately the mission is scrubbed in time as the bad guys get reinforcements because of a leak back home about the mission. Our Navy seal returns to the states to finish his work with the drug dealers, but also to do one more favor for the government before they give him a new identity and put him to work for them.

I loved Clear and Present Danger and Red Storm Rising, Patriot Games was okay and Hunt For Red October was straight-out boring in most parts,  but I read Without Remorse when it first came out and I had hoped that Clancy had taken a Creative Writing course in his spare time between reading technical manuals for Typhoon-class submarines and interviews with the CIA.  There is a different voice to Without Remorse.  Its straight-forward, kick-ass reading.  Reads like an early Metallica song.  This is the evolution of Mr. Clark, Clancy's spook character.  Vietnam-era.  Someone f*cks around with a girl he cares about and all hell breaks loose.  This is, hands down, the best Clancy book I have ever read.  It's like his version of Diry Harry.  Great.

I like that the story tells a believable fictionalized account of what happens to so many young people forced into prostitution and describes the hell of their life, detailing how they are victimized and controlled. to me, the hero is dumb and his character inconsistently written. dumb because the young woman tells him what she's been through and where, but he drives to that part of town anyway, confident he can protect himself and her, not asking himself what could happen if he were unable to handle the situation, though he knows nothing about the drug world or how it operates. I found his over confidence annoying, especially considering the slave pays with her life.

Second, I have just reviewed the one-star reviews of this book, and was amazed, though those people certainly have the right to their opinions. To me, this book is just something, once I have picked it up, that I am in deadly danger from, even if I have picked it up just to look at one section. I end up reading the whole thing. Again. There are sections that just demand that I read them, like where Nurse O'Toole alone sees John Kelly's face when he sees the last picture of Pam. The language is not perfect, but how that is described is very, very good. The scene with the pimp in New Orleans is interesting, particularly because Kelly decides to answer his question. The scene were Kelly reaches the Closest Point of Approach with the one drug dealer on the street is a personal favorite of mine.Tom Clancy wrote a realistic book about what a man would do if he had the training and the motivation and nothing to lose. The consequences Kelly inflicts upon those that hurt him are entirely realistic, and the fact that he considered himself better than his targets was also true to life. Soldiers of anykind who are that motivated would view the drug dealers as scum, and soldiers tend, no matter what a philosopher would tell you, to think in terms of good-guy/bad guy even when they are not so roused. Special Operations soldiers would be even more prone to this mentality, and the way Mr. Clancy has Kelly methodically roll them up is entirely chilling in its ruthlessness.At first, Kelly has no motivation but revenge. \Una salus victus nullam sperare salutem. The one hope of the damned is that they have no hope of salvation.\"" My apologies to linguists everywhere; I undoubtly butchered that translation",,and his motivation changes.

This book for me was one of those rare effortless reads where the pages turned on their own and I did not want to put it down.  I found the story to be completely plausible - if you have ever wondered what would have to happen in the life of a normal, non-psychopathic person that would turn them into a highly-skilled, cold-blooded killer, this is the answer.

,2242052,"A superb introduction into the shadowy world of John Kelly, aka John  Clark. From the moment he picks up the young female hitch hiker, and from  when she dies at the hands of the drug dealers, you know what happens, he  gets his own revenge. It was pretty awesome but alarming how Clancy went  into his own exact details on how Kelly/Clark builds his own firearms. So,  maybe liberties were taken and the narrative states a lot that he is a Navy  SEAL, trained to do all these things he does. But my one criticism is this  for the plot. If Sandra O'Toole, his nurse girlfriend really didn't like  him killing all these drug dealers when she found out he was responsible by  her own intuition, surely she would have left him? Any woman with enough  intelligence would! 'Without Remorse' - healthy attitude or a state of mind  from the indoctrinations of military training and the Vietnam War? Judge  for yourself.  So the revenge element becomes another Goons of  Hazzard/Death Wish type scenario. If one can convey the atmosphere of  despair at being a victim of a horrific crime like that as well as Clancy  and makes an impression on someone, is this a good thing? Think . . . I  know I was beaten up in school several times and I did take a violent  revenge, admittedly, but I never felt better for it. Kelly's portrayal as a  jarhead robot brainwashed by the ongoing war effort works in fiction,  though. Just don't emulate it. . .  As far as the CIA recruiting him for  his skills, this is an interesting angle. The Vietnam scenes of the POW  camp with the Russian and American officers held prisoner shows how in war,  people are the same. Humans, not combat robots. Just the same, discussing  each other's strategies on nuclear defence and asking themselves why they  are enemies?  Naval scenes with Admiral Greer in an early incarnation -  as excellent as ever! And we do see an early incarnation of Jack Ryan,  while his father Emmet hunts down Kelly.  Altogether, one to read for  yourself and one to think carefully about afterwards - does Kelly's end  justify the means? Drug dealers may be scum, but death puts them out of the  misery of living to regret what they've done wrong at the hands of the  crazies inside.

Kelly is an ex-Navy SEAL who is now an underwater demolitionist.  The book takes place in the early 1970's during the fading years of the Vietnam War.  Kelly's wife is killed in an automobile accident.  The book begins by describing his dealing with the loss of his wife.  Kelly then falls in love with Pam, a prostitute, who has escaped from her pimp, who works for an up and coming drug lord.  The pimp/drug lord has a hit done on Kelly and kidnaps Pam.  Though Kelly is left for dead, he is taken to the hospital and recovers.  In the meantime, Pam is brutally tortured and murdered.  As I do not want to give away the rest of the book, all I will say is that the rest of the book deals with vigilante justice.The length of the book is extremely intimidating when you first start reading.  However, the book reads like an excellent movie.  The story is told from three main viewpoints, Kelly's , the police, and the drug ring's.  Clancy does an excellent job of tying the three views of the same story together at the end.  The chapters get a little lengthy at times, thus not leaving a convenient place to stop reading.I would highly recommend anyone who likes reading fiction revolving around the military or vigilante justice.

Instead of heading straight for the cops he decides to joy ride in her old neighborhood where she is recognized and immediately becomes a target.

,2242052,"Tom Clancy's strength has been writing the techno-thriller.  The weak points in his books have been characterizations and dialog, especially casual conversation.  All of his characters have been one dimensional,  wooden stereotypes.  Trying to expand more on wooden characters is one of  the reasons his Executive Orders is so bad (one of many reasons).Without  Remorse is a basic action/revenge novel. It is set in the low tech drug  world. It relies much more on character and emotions. Some interest,  dimension, and character development is given to the hero by evolving him  into a revenge machine without remorse.  But, that is the only interesting  aspect of the hero and Clancy ends up cheapening it by later glorifying it  in this book and Executive Orders.  The other characters in the book aren't  very interesting.  Clancy is very awkard with the love stories and emotions  and some of it is just embarrassing.But Clancy isn't the only action  writer that has problems with character development (Ludlum is only mildly  better).  What's really important, is the book exciting?  The ending is  pretty good and there are a few good action sequences in the middle.  But,  there are long boring stretches while Clancy tries in vain to develop the  characters.This book is about the origins of Kelly, the CIA agent who  appears in most of the Jack Ryan books.  I started reading Debt of Honor,  but stopped when I heard about this book.  I switched to Without Remorse  because I thought that there might be important insights in this book that  lead up to the later books.  It turned out that there were no important  revelations here and it really has no impact on the later stories.

I've loved most of his work (things started going seriously south with Rainbow Six), in particular Without Remorse. A few weeks ago, I decided that I wanted to revisit this favorite, so I purchased the Kindle edition.This novel focuses on the events leading to John Kelly's transformation into Mr. Clark, a central figure in several of the Jack Ryan-centric novels. Largely absent from Without Remorse is Clancy's typical wide-angle view of events with periodic zooms into the events in one setting or another, though it's clear that the historical context shapes the story. The story is well-paced and Clancy does a solid job of making us care about the central characters.The Kindle edition of Without Remorse, however, reads like someone tore the pages out of the novel and scanned them into the computer using a version of OCR software dating back to the mid-90s. There are quite a lot of mangled words, spacing is often weird, and punctuation frequently doesn't make sense. If you can overlook this sort of thing, the Kindle edition will work just fine for you.

This is one of those books I knew Clancy needed to write, and hopefully he writes more, because Clark is fantastic character.Clearly the war on drugs has been lost at virtually every juncture. Traditional law enforcement is akin to giving everybody a can of Lysol and expecting the common cold to be cured. Yeah, you may get the obvious stuff, but there's so much out there, you're sure to miss enough to keep the supply of bacteria flowing.While I'm not a proponent of vigilantism, few people in this country have not been touched in some way by the pushers, cookers and dealers. They aren't just on the street corners in the bad neighborhoods, either. They inhabit every socioeconomic strata, including the gated communities inhabited by the most affluent.There are times where the viruses on humanity need to be cut out like the cancer they are, and a character like Clark can do it. Can you imagine a drug trade in a community where the dealers are shot without warning, upon getting caught dealing by a phantom hero? Or worse, are found naked and dying on the street after some torture in a hyperbaric chamber? I can.

All I have to say is that this books rocks. Clancy takes you for a ride. There is so many sub-plots in this book. So you can never get bored with it. At one time Kelly is doing this then he is doing something with the CIA. I mean it is a big action pack thriller.

I enjoyed the 2-level plot, wherein Kelly is dealing with  drug-dealing dirt-bags on the one hand, and his mission to Vietnam on the  other. The plot was realistic--the professional manner in which Kelly  carries out his dual missions was, I thought, very thoroughly thought out  and presented. I enjoyed also his portrayals of the American and Russian  spooks, and the Russian Air Force colonel.  My main complaint with Clancy's  writing occurs when he's trying to convey tender love thoughts towards the  women in Kelly's life--too much syrup (of the corn type).

But the other half of the novel is about his vendetta against a crime syndicate in Baltimore. What did they do to face the wrath of this one-man wrecking crew? They killed a girl who nurtured him in a time of need. Kelly's revenge is brutal amd just. There's an interrogation scene halfway through the book involving a decompression chamber that pushes the emotional boundaries of the novel and moved me to tears. The ending chase sequence explains how Kelly reemerges as Clark later in the Ryanverse timeline.",10/03/2009 0:00,Clancy's finest hour,5
,2242052,"As a youngster, I read and enjoyed Red Storm Rising, Hunt for Red October, Patriot Games, Clear and Present Danger, and Cardinal of the Kremlin. (I thought that Sum of All Fears was pushing it.) But Without Remorse is quite another story. Here Clancy reveals himself to be a real facist. Certainly the victims of Kelly/Clark's rage are not innocents, but they are pointless executed, and the book doesn't even take the time to explore the effect that this has on Clark or really give him any kind of depth. In Lethal Weapon, we only know that Riggs's wife is dead, this alone is enough to make him suicidal and add considerable depth to his character. In Without Remorse, the love interest's death is only exploited to give Clark an excuse to kill everyone. I found Clancy's obvious animus towards liberals and women distasteful and his lack of respect for human life and even a sense of the impact that taking another person's life has on your own--well, it is truely baffling to consider how a man who is marginally an intellectual can be that primative. He falls short even of the mark that his other novels set.

Chronilogically, this is the first story to take place in the &quot;Jack Ryan Universe&quot;, although it's only a two page scene where an 18 year old Jack discusses going into the Marines that we see the hero of the Clancy novels.The rest of the novel centers around CIA operative, instructor, and all around bad-ass John Clark.  We get to see what brought Clark into the CIA in the first place, as well as learn why is true past has been kept such a secret in the course of this story, which takes place during the '70s.Much of this novel is a story about revenge.  Picture a Navy Seal with a vendetta, and some of the outcome is obvious.  But what Clark is doing is highly illegal, and police investigators are closing in.

,2242052,"I've heard a number of mixed reviews on this book. Most people I've talked to say this book is just so so. Most people on here have written that this book is &quot;amazing&quot;, or &quot;Clancy's best&quot;. I'll agree with the former; the latter will always be up to debate.This book is different than the typical Clany novel in two ways.1) It doesn't feature Jack Ryan.2) It's a personal story.The first point is self explanitory, but the second may need clarification. Those that have read Clancy's other works understand his strenghts: weaving interesting characters in a technical environment designing thick plotlines that span global environments (that may have sounded dumb but it's true).Without Remorse is none of that. It's the story of one man and his quest for vengence. It's also an exploration of whether or not can be justified. Clancy keeps pushing the envelope, baraging the character(s) with events that will test even the most forgiving person's morals. Is vigilanteism justified? I've never read a book that poses as many arguments for it. And yet, even after Clancy makes every excuse in the world to justify Clarks actions in the book, he plainly and tastefully keeps the book as a whole objective, never glorifying violence.In the setting of Clark's quest for vengeance we also get to witness Clancy writing in a more intimate and emotional fashion. The book rarely strays from Clarks point of view (a first for this writer who is known for bouncing all over the place). The story really moved me emotionally a few times as Clancy unfolded the lives of the characters (almost cried in one part).People expecting stereotypical Clancy may be disappointed by this departure, but don't be mistaken; this is a fine book in it's own right. Never have I been more impressed with Clancy's writing.Why only four stars then? Well because honestly the book is not as strong on the plot department as most Clancy books, and the ending is not as climactic as Clancy readers have come to expect. This isn't to say the book is weak in those departments; just not that strong. The other strengths of this book help make up this novel's 'very good' (4 star) rating.",02/24/2001 0:00,A different kind of Clancy novel,4

If you have pictures of Huey helicopters on the cover, I'm expecting some good portion of this book to take place in Vietnam. However, most of the book is set in the streets hunting down and killing drug dealers (1 rightousness point!). Unprotected sex with an escaped prostitute (-1 logic point). Training with soldiers in the country (1 cool point). One car chase (-1 cliche point)Considering the length of the book, I expected more. I'd say this is a substandard Clancy book.

,2242052,"There are two specific reasons I rate this novel so low on the scale. First it is very long, tedious and at times laughable as far as plot and story line go. The characters are often cliche and difficult to take seriously and the scenes tend to be forced and come off as phony at best. Not present is the pins and needels descriptive narrative Clancy is so well known for. There are dozens of mistakes and errors and at times the plot gets away only to come back with an anti-climatic closure or worse, a very predictable one.Secondly without going as far as accusing Mr. Clancy of plagiarism, I will go as far as saying this story virtually mirrors that of Mack Bolan, the Executioner, written by Don Pendleton nearly 30 years ago. This is the story of the mysterious Mr. Clark who has so often come to the aid of Clancy's favorite protagonist, Jack Ryan. This novel is a prequel of several others in the Ryan series and attempts to explain who and what Clark is. Not only does it fail to do so, it takes a bit too much from the original Executioner novel. Worse, it doesn't have the gritty edge of Don pendleton's work and it is obvious it was written many years after the Vietnam war and the etire era it is supposed to depict. There are errors of detail and just plain poor development of the times and characters and their interactions.Read this one at your own risk or read it first to be more impressed with previous and latter offerings.

He shows absolutely no remorse and offers no apologies for exterminating the criminals who wreak havoc on society.

The question that lingered was, &quot;Who is John Clark and where did he come from?&quot;. Clancy brought us this book to answer those questions.The book's setting is enough to intrigue me, seeing as it was set in 1970 and I wasn't born until 12 years later! It reflects a different time period than the rest of the Clancy novels, which means a much smaller reliance on technology and more attention given to the personal aspect of the story (much like &quot;Patriot Games&quot;). At this point, John Clark isn't John Clark...he's John Kelly, the ex-Navy SEAL, an honest, hard-working man who has just lost his wife in a car accident. I won't go into what happens in the actual plot, but at times Kelly is forced to cross the lines of law to take necessary action, and even rejoins the service of his country.Later in the book, John Kelly assumes the moniker and the identity that Clancy readers have come to love...John Clark. There are times in the book that you can't believe some of the things that the 'good guy' is doing, but you're still rooting for him because it's part of the story and it's what HAS to happen. The character, and the plot, is extremely well written.Besides Clark, several other familiar Clancy characters are found in WITHOUT REMORSE. James Greer, Robert Ritter (from Clear and Present Danger), and a few others. Minor, yet recurring, character development is something that Clancy is an absolute master at.Even at 750 pages, WITHOUT REMORSE flies by with its furious pace and non-stop action.

John Clark has always been one of my favorite characters in Clancy's universe.  Jack is the idealist, Jim Greer is the wisdom, but John Clark has always been the man who holds the sword, errr.. gun.  An excellent book that tracks the birth of our dark hero from the US, to the humid jungles of Vietnam, and back again.  Along the way we will meet Sandy, Dr. Rosen, the tragic Pam, Emmett Ryan, Colonel Zachariahs and another one of my faves Yevgenievich Grishanov AKA Kolya. John is beset by tragedy and spends the remainder of the book trying to find resolution while helping out Jim Greer with a small problem over in The 'Nam.  The book reads as part spy novel, and part Death Wish homage.  It might not be for everyone but I've always enjoyed the spirit of the dark hero in books.

,2242052,"Without RemorseBy Tom ClancyReview by Roger D. NoriegaJohn Clark - Mister John Clark. CIA agent extradonaire. The man that the agency turns to when it wants the job done. He is the one that must go into hostile territory to bring someone out to safety. He blends in well, speaks several languages and is intelligent and smart - rare for the CIA. His only concern is to complete the mission, but he suffers the failings of real people, he makes mistakes and he does endure bouts of fear - fear of failure for the danger is always real and is what he lives for.John Terrance Kelly is an ex-seal recovering from the loss of his beloved wife and  unborn child, killed by by a mechanical failure on a semi-truck. On a get-away holiday Friday, John Kelly meets a hitchhiker and both become attached to each other right quick as both hide demons. He killed for a living and she was killing herself for her living.John discovers that she is a hooker and drug user and decides to clean her up and bring her back to the land of the living. She accepts him and all that he does for her, but she still fears those that kept her as a hooker: she knows that they can still hurt her as they hurt others - namely her fellow captive hookers. Kelly convinces her to speak to the police but before, Kelly decides to spend time in her old neighborhood while he was waiting for his secretive appointment with Baltimore's finest and they meet it with Billy, the pimp that kept Pam and the others doing their bidding. Kelly evades them with some slick maneuvering in the muddy lots of the abandoned neighborhood. Turns out that he didn't do enough as Billy and his buddies catch up with them and shot Kelly point-blank with a shotgun, take Pam and kill her.Kelly should have died, but he survived the wounds and he recovers with a simple mission on his mind: avenge the loss of Pam and maybe, just maybe, save others as well from their certain death at the hands of the drug-dealers.We learn what drives him and he realizes he made a mistake, a fatal mistake that cost Pam her life. He works out and gets into tip-top shape and he begins the hunt. He learns how the drug dealers operate and he begins to attack the drug dealers in different manners to through off the police of Baltimore. With each calculated kill, he moves deeper into the organization and he gains knowledge - all to avenge the loss of Pam. He has no other choice, live with her loss, a loss he caused, or avenge her so that she can rest as well as he.On the other side of the world, a super-secret remote-piloted drone snaps a picture of an American POW declared dead by the Vietcong being tortured.

This book was actually created after The Hunt for Red October and Patriot Games, but is the first  in the series. It is- more or less- a prelude to the series. Amazingly  enough, Jack Ryan does not play a particuly big role in this book. But none  the less, Tom Clancy shows how one man can change from a normal citizen  into a cold-blooded killer who will stop at nothing to reach his goal. I  suggest this book to anyone who likes Tom Clancy and is willing to devote  some time to a book. This is one of my favorite books in the series right  next to The Hunt for Red October, which has to be the best.

That is compounded by the author occasionally telling you how to build a watch when you just wanted to know the time.  Do we really need a manual on building sound suppressors for handguns?The various plots eventually start to come together but, by that time, I was losing interest and skimming over substantial amounts of material trying to get on with the story.

I didn't rate this book higher because I feel the story could have been done with less than 750 pages, that's two pretty good sized books. Also much of the book takes place in Vietnam & details some Navy Seal / SOG action.

John Clark).Kelly, still grieving the loss of his wife, meets an exciting young woman with whom he develops an instant chemistry. Within just a few days of inviting Pam onboard his boat and getting to know her, he falls head over heels in love--but not before discovering that she's a drug addict and a former prostitute. Undeterred, Kelly sets out to cure Pam of her addictions. As part of the healing process, Kelly takes Pam back to the streets of Baltimore. As extremely bad luck would have it, Pam is recognized by her former pimp, who shoots Kelly and kidnaps the girl. Days later, Kelly turns up in a hospital, and Pam turns up dead. Kelly vows to rehabilitate himself and avenge Pam's murder, eventually drawing on his considerable skills as a former Navy SEAL and embarking on a campaign of terror against the city's drug world that has cops scratching their heads and dealers quaking in their dark alleys.Meanwhile, in war-torn Vietnam, a U.S. spy drone snaps a photo of a high-ranking military official who is supposed to be dead--a man with knowledge that could be extremely beneficial to America's enemies. The Pentagon's top brass decides to stage a rescue, and who better to lead the mission than former SEAL John Kelly? Now, torn between his desire to punish his girlfriend's murderers and his loyalty to his country, Kelly has to decide which mission is more important. The choice he makes will affect not only the course of Kelly's life but the very condition of his soul.The literary device of hero vs. human evil is a familiar one, and the ethical questions the book raises are worth considering. As with many of this author's novels, caution is required; the book contains accounts of torture, physical and emotional abuse, drug use, and war violence. The first chapter contains a relatively mild sex scene, and bad language is used throughout. But Clancy is a master of political and military intrigue, and the objectionable material is included not for its own sake but to support the compelling story and believable characters.

This one has, for me, a more personal and intense feel to it, and I love the way several threads are weaved consistently throughout the whole book.  Admittedly, for me, things were a little confusing at times in the initial stages of the book, but that was only very temporary, as once the various characters and settings were fleshed out a bit, things became very clear.  The writing was lean and to the point, and the crispness of the action and dialogue kept this novel very appealing and it really kept my attention.  I finished it in a very few days, whereas a more 'average' novel sometimes will take me several weeks to finish.  That is how intense this one was.  Without giving anything away in the form of details, I thought that the main protagonist of the novel was very well written, and was a very complex character, one for whom you could feel intense sympathy, admiration and revulsion all at the same time.  A key in the timeline of things in the Clancy universe is that though this is a somewhat more recent novel, it is actually the prequel to, the background for the Jack Ryan novels that were written first.  Sort of like Star Wars 1,2 and 3 were prequels but were made after 4,5 and 6.  So if you haven't read any of the Jack Ryan centered novels like Red October, you might want to start with this one.

I only knew that this book was all about how &quot;John Kelly&quot; became &quot;Mr. Clark&quot;. I have come across &quot;Mr. Clark&quot; on many of Clancy's books previously but he was always a bit of a strange one to me. I'm glad I read this book as it gave me a great insight into how &quot;Mr. Clark&quot; became what he is today. It was written in the usual Clancy's thrilling and detailed ways and I just loved that part of it.But I have a few complaints. Firstly, I did not like the way our &quot;hero&quot; took the law into his own hands,.. it almost spoilt the whole book for me at one stage (when he actually tortured a man to his eventual death). Secondly, I thought Clancy introduced a few unusual and out-of-character twists in the story at certain stages that seemed to distance the story from reality. For example, how John (an expert who always seem to take no chances in anything he does) took a great gamble by driving Pam through her old rough neighbourhood without even a simple disguise, and also the place where John slept in the car with Pam in the same neighbourhood where a few minutes ago they were being chased by a drug-gang.... sloppy work Mr. Clancy.Other than that it was generally a good read.",02/16/2004 0:00,"Liked it,... mostly...",4

An interesting idea, but unlike Mr. Clancy's usual subject matter he demonstrates little knowledge of the domestic U.S. drug trade.

I don't know what the process is for converting a book to kindle format, but if I had to guess based on the types of typos that I'm seeing in there I'd guess it's some for of OCR (which is fine, but they really need to do a better job at proof-reading the digitally converted text).  I've noticed these types of errors in some other kindle books, but this one seems to be much worse than any of the others I've seen in the past (there seems to be an error every few pages).",10/04/2010 0:00,"Great book, kindle version has many typos (poor OCR???)",5

,2242052,The overwhelming detail makes the book a ponderous read.  The plotting is excellent but the multiple story lines and characters require the reader to keep a cheat sheet of character identities.,02/10/2014 0:00,ponderous,3
,2242052,"Im really not a huge Clancy fan,I liked Rainbow six and clear and present danger but the others I read were very average and boring,but Without Remorse is probably my favorite book of all time.I have read it 3 times and it is enjoyable from begining to end.If they only could of done a movie of it.But like the other movies they would of messed it up.",01/13/2011 0:00,Clancys best,5
,2242052,"This story focuses on John Clark, a change from the usually Jack Ryan stories.  Clark is shown in the gritty special ops world that we always new he had in him.  Clancy takes Clark and fleshes him out in ways that he was never able to do in previous novels.  This story is not a &quot;political thriller&quot; the way that Jack Ryans stories might be called, this is an action story.  When you read this hold on for a great action filled twisty-turvey ride.",11/04/2001 0:00,A great story,4
